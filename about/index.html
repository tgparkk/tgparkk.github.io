    <h2>Why I Created This Blog</h2>
    
    <p>
      I started this blog to document my journey in software development, share the solutions to problems 
      I encounter, and contribute to the programming community. By writing about these topics, I hope to 
      deepen my own understanding while helping others facing similar challenges.
